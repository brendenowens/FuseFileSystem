\section{Accomplishments}
When we last met we wrote the rest of the code for our fuse filesystem and have completed the main functions that are needed for the filesystem. We are now commenting the code that make up the functions. We fixed our writing problems and also our reading problems.   
\section{Goals for Next Meeting}
For our next meeting we plan on getting the bits turned into bytes and from there turn the bytes into ASCII characters and save them to the file and from there our read function will have an easier time displaying the random bytes.
\section{Items Left To Do}
As of right now we are done and will just be testing out different cases that might arise. We will even decided if we really want to seed a random number generator to compensate for a lack of random bits.
