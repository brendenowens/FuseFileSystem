\section{Accomplishments}
When we last met we figured out the code for the write function and for the read function in the Fuse python code and tried to implement it but ran out of time and couldn't test to see if everything worked correctly. We did create a file that contained all of our random bits and can read from that file. We also created a python progam that will call our filesystem functions to make sure that we have them working correctly. 
\section{Goals for Next Meeting}
For our next meeting we plan on getting a function in the Fuse class done and ready for testing so that the other functions can be focused on by the group. We also will be dividing up the functions that we have left to write so that we can get this project done faster. We will also get the write function more fine tuned as to where it saves and what it saves. 
\section{Items Left To Do}
Our group still needs to finish the Fuse functions in Python and test to make sure that everything is working correctly and to the specifications that we have come up with. We also need to make sure that everything is functioning correctly after we have everything implemented and working correctly alone.
