\section{Accomplishments}
When we last met we wrote the code for the write function and debugged what was wrong with the implementation that we chose. We also discovered that threading will be a problem with our raspberry code and fuse system code. 
\section{Goals for Next Meeting}
For our next meeting we plan on getting the rest of the write function working correctly and then moving onto the read function and debugging it and fixing our threading issue and finding some different way of keeping track of the raspberry pi program and the fuse system program so that we don't have them running indefinately after the user unmounts the fuse system.
\section{Items Left To Do}
Our group still needs to finish the Fuse functions in Python and test to make sure that everything is working correctly and to the specifications that we have come up with. We also need to make sure that everything is functioning correctly after we have everything implemented and working correctly alone.
